# EduQuick Updates

EduQuick is designed to fetch the latest script version automatically. However, when the installed bookmarklet itself changes, you may need to perform a manual update to maintain full functionality.

If you see an update notification within EduQuick, follow the steps below.

## ⏱️ Update Delay

If you know a new update has been released but you aren't seeing it yet, please be patient.

Due to how the script is delivered to your browser, it can take anywhere from **12 hours to 1 week** for a new update to reach every user. If your bookmarklet is working normally, you do not need to take any action; the update will arrive automatically once the cache has updated.
