# EduQuick Updates

If you’ve received a message about updating, take a screenshot and follow these instructions.

This means your **bookmarklet is out of date**.

EduQuick automatically fetches the latest script version from GitHub, but sometimes the **bookmarklet itself** - the code that injects EduQuick into Educake - needs to be updated manually.
