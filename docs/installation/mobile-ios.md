# Installing on iOS (Safari)

Unlike Desktop browsers, iOS requires a manual bookmark setup to execute scripts. Follow these steps to install EduQuick on your iPhone or iPad.

## Steps

### 1. Copy the script

Open the source file and copy the entire block of code to your clipboard.

To ensure the tool displays correctly on mobile devices, follow these usage tips:

- **Login:** Ensure you are logged into your Educake account first.
- **Orientation:** Rotate your device to **Landscape (horizontal)** mode.
- **Zoom:** Zoom out fully so the page is at its default scale.
- **Launch:** Open your bookmarks and tap **EduQuick** to run the script.

> **Tip:** If the script doesn't run, double-check that the URL in your bookmark starts with `javascript:`. Some mobile browsers strip this prefix during pasting.
