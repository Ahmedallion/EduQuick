## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Issues

-   **Mobile devices are not supported**  
    EduQuick is designed for desktop browsers. Mobile support may be added in the future, but there are no guarantees.

-   **UI may look odd on some browsers or screen sizes**  
    The UI and CSS are currently optimised for my own setup. Support for more browsers and resolutions will improve over time.

-   **Educake account customisation settings are not fully supported**  
    Certain Educake UI or account customisation options may interfere with EduQuick. Better handling is planned.

-   **Educake updates can temporarily break things**  
    Educake UI or backend changes may cause features to stop working until EduQuick is updated.

If something looks broken and isn’t listed here, feel free to open an issue.

## 🧪 Running Locally (Development)

You can run EduQuick locally if you want to inspect, modify, or develop it.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js
-   npm

### Steps

##### 1. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the dev server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmedallion/EduQuick
cd EduQuick
npm install
npm run dev
```

> By default, the dev server uses **port 5173**.
> You **must change it** in [`package.json`](package.json) if you want a different port, and also update the port in the local bookmarklet so it points to the same source.

##### 2. Install the Bookmarklet

You have two options to add the bookmarklet:

###### Option 1: Import HTML (Recommended)

1. Download [`install/eduquick-dev.html`](install/eduquick-dev.html).
2. Open your bookmarks manager:

    - Chrome / Edge: `chrome://bookmarks`

3. Drag & drop the HTML file, or use the **Import** option.
4. A bookmark folder called **EduQuick Dev** will be added.

###### Option 2: Manual Bookmarklet

1. Open [`install/eduquick-dev.js`](install/eduquick-dev.js).
2. Copy **all** the contents.
3. Create a new bookmark:

    - **Name:** `EduQuick Dev`
    - **URL:** Paste the copied JavaScript.

4. Save the bookmark.

##### 3. Usage

### Bugs & Issues

This is my **first major public JavaScript project**, and I’m still learning - so yes, the code _will_ be messy in places.

If you run into a bug or issue, please open a GitHub issue and include as much detail as possible.  
You’ll be guided by an issue template, but especially helpful details include:

-   Browser name and version
-   Page / quiz type
-   What you expected to happen
-   What actually happened
-   Console errors (if any)

It genuinely helps and saves a lot of back-and-forth.
