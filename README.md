EduQuick is a simple tool for **[Educake](https://www.educake.co.uk)** that helps you get quizzes done faster.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Issues

- **Mobile devices are not fully supported**  
  EduQuick is designed for desktop browsers. Mobile support may be added in the future, but there are no guarantees.

- **UI may look odd on some browsers or screen sizes**  
  The UI and CSS are currently optimised for my own setup. Support for more browsers and resolutions will improve over time.

- **Educake account customisation settings are not fully supported**  
  Certain Educake UI or account customisation options may interfere with EduQuick. Better handling is planned.

- **Educake updates can temporarily break things**  
  Educake UI or backend changes may cause features to stop working until EduQuick is updated.

If something looks broken and isn’t listed here, feel free to open an issue.
