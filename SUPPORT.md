## 🐛 Bugs & Technical Issues

If something is broken or not working as expected, **please open a GitHub issue** instead of DMing.

When reporting a bug, include:

-   Browser name & version
-   What page / quiz type you were on
-   What you expected to happen
-   What actually happened
-   Console errors (if any)

This helps me fix things much faster.
